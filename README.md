YouTube Watch Party Application
This project is a YouTube Watch Party Application that allows users to create rooms where they can watch YouTube videos together in real time. All participants in a room are synchronized to the same video timestamp. Any action performed by one user, such as seeking to a different timestamp, automatically updates the video for all participants in the room.
